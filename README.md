# Resume Screening with ML and NLP

A machine learning model to help employers by analysing resumes and CVs, surfacing candidates that best match the position and filtering out those who don't.



## Description

1. Definition: Resume screening is the process of determining whether a candidate is qualified for a role based his or her education, experience, and other information captured on their resume.

2. How to screen resumes: First, screen resumes based on the job’s minimum qualifications. Second, screen resumes based on the job’s preferred qualifications. Third, screen resumes based on the shortlist of candidates you want to move onto the interview phase.

3. The challenges recruiters face while screening resumes: The high volume of resumes received – up to 88% of them are unqualified – greatly increases time to fill. Recruiters face increased pressure to show quality of hire but lack tools to link their resume screening to post-hire metrics.

4. Tech innovations in resume screening: Intelligent resume screening by using AI to learn from historical hiring decisions to improve quality of hire and reduce employee turnover.

## Tech Stack

Python - Python is a programming language that is preferred for programming due to its vast features, applicability, and simplicity. The Python programming language best fits machine learning due to its independent platform and its popularity in the programming community.

pandas - pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real-world data analysis in Python.

Matplotlib and Seaborn - Matplotlib is mainly deployed for basic plotting. Visualization using Matplotlib generally consists of bars, pies, lines, scatter plots and so on. Seaborn: Seaborn, on the other hand, provides a variety of visualization patterns. It uses fewer syntax and has easily interesting default themes.

NLTK - NLTK, or Natural Language Toolkit, is a Python package that you can use for NLP. A lot of the data that you could be analyzing is unstructured data and contains human-readable text. Before you can analyze that data programmatically, you first need to preprocess it.

Scikit Learn / Sklearn - Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.


Multinomial Naive Bayes - Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is a probabilistic learning method that is mostly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The algorithm is based on the Bayes theorem and predicts the tag of a text.
